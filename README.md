# MineSweeper
Implementation of Minesweeper Game

Learned and Improvised from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpp-implementation-minesweeper-game

Based on difficulty three levels are available. User can select move. First move of user is always safe.

To make it more efficient if there are no adjacent mines to selected cell, then we recursively select all the safe adjacent cells reducing the time of the game-play.
